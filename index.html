        You are super nervous for your first ever date with capybara. You meet
        them in a fancy restaurant and sit down opposite. You don't know what to
        say but don't worry- there is a magical prompt card floating on the screen
        which will give you options for conversation. Try and choose ones you think
        capybara might like and the magical love-meter will tell you how
        successful the date is going. Good luck!
